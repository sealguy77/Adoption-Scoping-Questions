## Tips for Using During Live Conversations

### Before the Meeting
- Paste the prompt into your AI assistant
- Have it ready in a separate window/screen
- Brief the customer that you'll be taking notes throughout

### During the Meeting
- **Read questions naturally** - Don't read verbatim; make them conversational
- **Take notes or copy-paste** responses into the AI
- **Weave in clarifying questions** naturally when AI suggests them
- Use phrases like "That's helpful - can you tell me more about..." or "I want to make sure I understand..."

### Managing the Flow
- **Don't rush** - It's okay to spend more time on areas with gaps
- **Capture tangents** but redirect to stay on track
- **Reference your framework** - You can say you're checking your notes to ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Stay flexible** - Mark sections complete but be ready to circle back if needed

### After Each Section
- Briefly review the AI's analysis
- Ask any critical clarifying questions before moving on
- Summarize: "Let me make sure I captured that correctly..."

## Common Scenarios & How to Handle

| Scenario | How to Handle |
|----------|---------------|
| **Customer doesn't know** | Note it as a gap; AI will flag it in the assessment |
| **Customer is vague** | AI will suggest probing questions to get specifics |
| **Customer is overly optimistic** | AI will identify this and suggest reality-checking questions |
| **Running out of time** | Ask AI which sections are most critical given what you've learned so far |
| **Customer goes off-topic** | Capture useful info, then gently redirect to the framework |
| **Need to circle back** | It's okay to jump around - note what needs follow-up |

## Example Opening Flow

```
You: [Paste prompt into AI assistant]

AI: Great! I'm ready to help you with this scoping conversation. 
     Let me start by getting some context:
     
     1. Who is the customer? (Company name, industry, size)
     2. Who are you speaking with? (Name, role/title, department)  
     3. What is their role in this project?
     4. Why are you having this conversation today?

You: [Provides context - e.g., "Contoso Corp, manufacturing, 5000 employees. 
     Speaking with Jane Smith, VP of IT. She's the project sponsor. 
     This is early discovery for a Microsoft 365 Copilot rollout."]

AI: Perfect. Based on her role as VP of IT and project sponsor, I'll pay 
    special attention to change management capabilities and user readiness, 
    and will help you probe for cultural factors she may not be as close to. 
    
    Let's start with Section 1: Project & Change Scope. 
    Ask them these questions...

You: [Has conversation with customer, then shares responses]

AI: [Analyzes responses, identifies gaps, suggests follow-up questions]

You: [Asks follow-up questions, shares additional info]

AI: Great, I have what I need for this section. Ready to move to Section 2?

You: Yes

AI: Section 2: Executive Sponsorship & Leadership...
```

## Why This Approach Works

✅ **Structured yet flexible** - Comprehensive framework that adapts to the conversation  
✅ **Real-time intelligence** - AI identifies issues as they emerge, not after the fact  
✅ **Role-aware analysis** - Adjusts for perspective bias based on who you're speaking with  
✅ **Gap identification** - Surfaces missing information before it becomes a problem  
✅ **Actionable output** - Specific recommendations with owners and timelines  
✅ **Evidence-based** - Assessment tied directly to conversation details

## Best Practices

1. **Start with context** - Always provide the AI with customer and contact information first
2. **Be thorough** - Better to over-share customer responses than under-share
3. **Trust the process** - Let the AI guide you through all sections systematically
4. **Document as you go** - Copy AI analysis into your notes/CRM for future reference
5. **Follow up on gaps** - If critical info is missing, schedule follow-up conversations
6. **Share the assessment** - Use AI output as basis for proposals, statements of work, or project plans
